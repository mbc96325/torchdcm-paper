# Solver Attempt Matrix

Each benchmark case is attempted with every configured solver where an aligned wrapper exists. Runtimes report estimation plus covariance on one logical CPU.
`ok` means the solver completed the aligned case, `failed` means the wrapper was attempted but failed, and `unsupported` means no aligned wrapper exists for that solver/model case.
